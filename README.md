# AR Camera Motion Tracking
 
A AR based Camera Tracking Solution
Still in the early development

Goal is to record and export the camera movement to a common 3d exchange format.
I also would like to include runtime gltf model loading so you can try to record a 3D Object with your smartphone.
 
Right now you can record the camera translation and rotation to a json file.
This file can be converted to a Unity Animation Clip, but only in the Unity Editor currently.

In the Release Section you can find the pre build Android Recording App and the prebuild Windows Viewer App.
